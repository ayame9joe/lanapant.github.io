**Francis Bacon** seems to represent the degree to which the demands of traditional figurative painting can be forced into a compromise with those of Modernism.  He was an extremely traditional figure. He worked with old materials, oil paint on canvas, and he accepted the discipline of the old formats.

## His most faumous works :

### Three Studies of Lucian Freud,1969

*Was sold at Christie's in New York for US $142.4m*
