**Doris Salcedo**  is a Colombian-born sculptor. Her work is infused with a sense of loss and mortality. These themes stem from her own personal history. Members of her own family were among the many people who have disappeared in politically troubled Colombia. Much of her work deals with the fact that, while the death of a loved one can be mourned, their disappearance leaves an unbearable emptiness.

## Her famous works :

###Shibboleth

*Shibboleth was the title of a temporary art installation placed  in the Tate Modern in 2007. The work took the form of a long crack in the floor.*
