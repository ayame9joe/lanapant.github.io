###### *"My paintings doesn not come from the easel. I hardly ever stretch my canvas before painting. I prefer to tack the unstretched canvas on the hard wall or floor: I need the resistance of a hard surface. On the floor I feel more at ease. I feel nearer, more part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting."* - J.Pollock

**Jackson Pollock** is known for his style : free, informal abstraction, based on a technique of dripping and smearing paint on to the canvas.
