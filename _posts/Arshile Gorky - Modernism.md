**Arshile Gorky** was the *transitional figure*, the most important link between European Surralism and what was to follow. His early work shows a steady progression through the basic Modernist styles, typical of an artist in a provincial enviroment who is conscious of his own isolation.

He was influenced by :
*Cezanne
*Picasso
*Magritte
*Tanguy

His most famous works :
