Tracey Emin is an English artist. She is part of the group known as Britartists or YBAs (Young British Artists).

## Her most famous work :

###Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 ("The Tent")

Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995 was a tent appliquéd with 102 names of the people she had slept with up to the time of its creation in 1995.[2] The title is often misinterpreted as a euphemism indicating sexual partners and the work termed "a list of all the people that Emin has ever had sex with", but is in fact intended more inclusively.

* **"The Tent"** was sold for $60 000*
